# My Git and GitHub Practices | Mis Pr√°cticas de Git & Github:

#Git #Github #VersionControl   

This is a learning and experimentation space where I put into practice the commands and workflows of Git (the version control system) and GitHub (the repository hosting platform).

Here I will upload and document different scenarios and commands to consolidate my understanding of how to work with repositories, branches, merges, and collaboration.

### About this Repository
This repository is my personal "sandbox" for:

- Understanding Git fundamentals: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log.
- Managing branches: git branch, git checkout, git merge, git rebase.
- Interacting with remote repositories: git clone, git push, git pull, git fetch.
- Resolving merge conflicts: Learning to identify and troubleshoot problems when integrating changes.
- Undoing changes: git revert, git reset.
- Working with tags: git tag.
- Common Workflows: Demonstrate how these commands are applied in real-world development situations.
- Basic GitHub Collaboration: Forking, Pull Requests (PRs).
